## Summary of Disscussions

### Fisrt discussion (11-21)

After the disscussion, we got to the consensus of building a scene like Monument Valley (纪念碑谷) or City of Sky (天空之城), which provide the busy modern man with a place to find what really matters in their mind. In this wonderland, we provide player with a place like a mountain, flying high over the ground. You can easily rotate the view and zoom-in and zoom-out to appreciate every aspect of this mountain, just like a God.

Moreover, there are events happening in this place, driven by time and events to improve playability.
