## Summary of Disscussions

### Fisrt discussion (time: 11-21, partners: except 郝家辉)

After the disscussion, we got to the consensus of building a scene like Monument Valley (纪念碑谷) or City of Sky (天空之城), which provide the busy modern man with a place to find what really matters in his mind. In this wonderland, we provide players with a place like a mountain, flying high over the ground. You can easily rotate the view and zoom-in and zoom-out to appreciate every aspect of this mountain, just like a God. And do meditation.

Moreover, there are events happening in this place, like dropping a boll, which can be driven by time and events to improve playability.
